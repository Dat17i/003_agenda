# #3 Create a Web Page with a List of Students
## The Job today is to create this index page

<img src="/students_index.png" />   

This will involve:
* Html Table tags
* Styling through CSS
  * In both the HTML and CSS case, you will learn through the **LTS method** _(Learning through stealing)_ 
* Creating a **Student.java** class, which will be the data type of the ArrayList of Students
* Sending data from the Controller.
* Recieving and displaying data in the View.
* Getting a deeper understanding of the MVC architecture pattern.
